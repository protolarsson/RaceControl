# Race Control
Race Control is an open source [F1TV](https://f1tv.formula1.com) desktop client for Windows. It can be used to watch F1TV content (both live streams and video on demand) in the highest quality available, using one of three supported video players. The goal of this project is to improve the overall F1TV experience by implementing features not found in the official F1TV website and apps, while still being easy to set up and use.

## Features
* Easy to set up and use, no editing of config files needed
* Fast and user-friendly user interface
* Watch F1TV live streams in the highest quality available (1080p at the moment)
* Supports three different video players (internal player, VLC and MPV)
* Open as many streams as you like, using the layout that you like
* Save your custom video player layout, so you don't have to position your windows manually every time you watch a session
* Cast to your Chromecast with a single click of a button (internal player and VLC only)
* Experimental synchronization of streams (replays only at the moment)

## Installation
* Download the latest release and extract the zip-file to a location of your choice
* Make sure you have the [.NET Core runtime (desktop)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) version 3.1 or above installed
* Run RaceControl.exe to start the application

## FAQ
#### Why do I get a login popup? What credentials do I use to login?
You need an F1TV account to watch F1TV streams. If you want to watch race replays, an F1TV Access subscription is required. If you want to watch live sessions, an F1TV Pro subscription is required. You can create an account and subscribe at http://f1tv.formula1.com.

#### What happens with my credentials when I login?
Your F1TV login credentials are stored locally in the Windows Credential Manager, so you don't have to login every time you start the application. If you wish to switch to a different F1TV account, press the button 'Delete stored credentials' located in 'Options'. Your credentials will be removed and you will be asked to login again.

#### Why is the VLC button disabled?
You need to have VLC media player installed on your machine. The location of your VLC installation will be automatically detected.

#### Do I need to install MPV separately to use it with Race Control?
No, Race Control comes with a recent version of MPV included in the release.

#### Can you add support for my favourite media player?
Maybe, please create an issue (feature request) and I will consider it. As a workaround, you can use the Copy-button to generate a tokenized link to the stream that is copied to your clipboard. Open the link with a media player of your choice to watch the stream.
